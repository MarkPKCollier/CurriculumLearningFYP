"""Context manager to switch a custom getter on or off."""

class Context(object):
  """Contextually switching a custom getter on.

  Example usage, using `snt.custom_getters.stop_gradient` with `Context` to
  selectively disable gradients flowing to variables for particular connections
  of the module:

  ```python
    custom_getter = snt.custom_getters.Context(snt.custom_getters.stop_gradient)
    lin = snt.Linear(10, custom_getter=custom_getter)

    lin(net1)  # custom getter not used, gradients on
    with custom_getter:
      lin(net2)  # custom getter used, gradients off
  ```

  Warning: If the custom getter affects the way the variable is created, then
  switching it on or off after the variable has been created will have no
  effect. For example, it is not possible to selectively switch off
  trainability using `custom_getters.non_trainable`, since this is a
  creation-time attribute. It is however possible to selectively switch
  off gradients using `custom_getters.stop_gradient`, since
  this applies an operation to the variable.

    Args:
      getter: The custom getter which we may want to switch on.
      verbose: Log out every time a variable is fetched, and whether or not
        `getter` is used.

      A custom getter which can also be used as a context manager.
